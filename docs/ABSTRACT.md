# AI Shield - Project Abstract

- **AI-powered antivirus system** leveraging machine learning to detect malware and system anomalies across files, network, and web traffic.

- **Multi-layered security approach** combining static file analysis, behavioral sandbox execution, network monitoring, and cloud-delivered threat intelligence.

- **Machine learning models** classify files and detect unusual behavior patterns to identify new and evolving threats in real-time.

- **Automated threat response** system that quarantines malicious files, blocks suspicious connections, and provides comprehensive security monitoring, enhancing traditional antivirus solutions through adaptive intelligence and multi-vector protection.
